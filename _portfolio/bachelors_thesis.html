My Bachelor's thesis work. In it I recreated the work of Aiello et al. (2019) "Large-scale and high-resolution analysis of food purchases and health outcomes". My review concluded that their work uses income deprivation instead of other income variables to conclude no relation between nutrition related prescription when controlling for purchasing behaviour. Using a variety of penalised methods, including IV-Lasso, I had found a significant relationship between neighbourhood income and health outcomes.
