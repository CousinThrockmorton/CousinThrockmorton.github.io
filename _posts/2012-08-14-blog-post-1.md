In this post I wanted to explore the connections I have found between my work as a bike mechanic 

I got into bikes out of necessity. After moving to Amsterdam for my master's I had the rather typical experience of needing a bike. A quick search on marktplaats lead me to De Pijp, where I met the Professor. The Professor was a skinny dutch man with scarce dangled white hair and a face tired and wirnkled by years of many rainy winters. He greeted me at the door with rolling a cigarett and invited me in to persent a green old dutch bike. It wasn't your typical Dutch city bike frame but hand built with six gears and he threw in a chain with it too. For all of 70 Euro's I was very happy.

Until about 10 minutes later when the chain had snapped at the end of the corner. I walked back to ask for help, instead I got my first lesson from the Professor. He got a chain tool and showed me how to work it. My hands got greasy but the links popped out and I got home on my new bike just fine.
